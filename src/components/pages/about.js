	<h4>Many manufacturing companies are diversifying their marketing efforts from solely focusing on tradeshows, print ads, and press releases to increasing digital content marketing in order to generate more leads for their sales team.

This doesn’t mean manufacturing marketing departments are depending on their contact pages or pricing request forms for demand generation. You can use your website and creative content to get your prospects excited about your company’s products.

Whether you make fasteners, paper products, or appliances, creating content with the intent of lead generation for your manufacturing company can establish a more sustainable system for filling your funnel without relying on short-term campaigns or events like tradeshows. In other words, this content keeps bringing in leads long after it’s been created.</h4>
